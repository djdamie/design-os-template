# Workflow Rules & Best Practices

## Core Principles

### 1. 100% Creative Fulfillment
> "Always aim for 100% creative fulfillment - never 90%"

This is TF's north star. Every brief should be executed to fully meet the client's creative vision, not just "good enough."

**What this means:**
- Look for extra ideas beyond the brief
- Suggest different approaches
- Understand the musical impact potential
- Don't settle for "close enough"

### 2. Business Flexibility
When budget is constrained, propose alternatives:
- Affordable licensing options
- Bespoke/custom production
- Cover versions
- Term/territory modifications
- Fallback options at different price points

### 3. Brief Categories
Every brief should capture 6 categories of information:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Business** | Client, budget, territory, rights |
| **Creative** | Mood, genre, references, direction |
| **Technical** | Lengths, formats, stems |
| **Contextual** | Campaign, audience, brand |
| **Deliverables** | What to deliver, when |
| **Competitive** | What others are doing |

## Brief Quality Standards

### Critical Fields (Must Have)
Without these, project cannot proceed:
- Client name
- Territory
- Media types
- Deadline
- Budget (for classification)

### Important Fields (Should Have)
Help ensure good results:
- Brand name
- Creative direction
- Mood keywords
- Reference tracks
- Video lengths

### Helpful Fields (Nice to Have)
Enhance output quality:
- Campaign context
- Target audience
- Brand values
- Competitor info
- Previous music used

### Completeness Scoring
- **0-30%:** Cannot start work - request more info
- **30-60%:** Can start with assumptions - flag uncertainties
- **60-80%:** Good working brief - proceed with clarifications
- **80-100%:** Excellent brief - full confidence

## Search Strategy Rules

### Request vs Playlist
- **C-Type:** Request first (proven most successful)
- **B-Type:** Both request AND playlist
- **A-Type:** Both request AND playlist, plus custom mailouts

### Music Source Hierarchy
1. **TF Platform catalog** - First check internal library
2. **Pre-cleared options** - Fastest path to delivery
3. **Member submissions** - Via request system
4. **External licensing** - Labels/publishers
5. **Custom production** - Bespoke creation

### Quality Thresholds by Type
- **SYNCH_A:** Highest quality, verified rights only
- **SYNCH_B:** High quality, flexible on some rights
- **SYNCH_C:** Good quality, budget conscious

## Communication Rules

### Client Communication
- Account Manager is primary client contact
- All client comms go through AM
- Music team provides technical input
- Management involved for A-type strategic discussions

### Internal Communication
- Slack channels for project discussion
- Brief stored in Nextcloud for reference
- Activity logged in system
- Status updates via Slack bot

### Response Timing
| Urgency | First Response | First Presentation |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Standard | 24h | 5 business days |
| Rush | 4h | 2-3 business days |
| Urgent | 1h | 24-48 hours |

## Quality Check Points

### Before Sending to Client
1. **List complete?** All positions filled
2. **Rights verified?** TBC items flagged
3. **Quality check?** Tracks match brief
4. **Presentation style?** Appropriate format
5. **Management review?** (B/A types)

### After Client Receives
1. Monitor engagement (3 days)
2. Follow up if no response
3. Double down on favorites
4. Prepare alternatives if needed

## Clearance Rules

### TBC (To Be Cleared) Handling
- Flag any track with unclear rights
- Check before including in shortlist
- Don't send to client until cleared
- Have alternatives ready

### Rights Holder Communication
- Draft initial email with fee estimate
- Include buyout terms from brief
- Track response times
- Escalate if no response in 48h

### Approval Requirements
| Type | Approval Needed |
|------|-----------------|
| C-Type | Music team can approve |
| B-Type | PM/AM approval |
| A-Type | Management approval required |

## File Management

### Nextcloud Structure
```
/01 - Team share/Projects/BriefBot/
  └── {case_number} - {case_title}/
      ├── {catchy_case_id} - Brief.md
      └── {catchy_case_id} - Brief - v{n}.md
```

### Versioning
- Keep all versions of brief
- Log what changed between versions
- Never delete, only archive

## AI Enhancement Rules

### What AI Should Do
- Extract structured data from messy briefs
- Identify missing critical information
- Suggest clarification questions
- Enhance vague terms with specific parameters
- Calculate margins and classify projects

### What AI Should NOT Do
- Make creative decisions without human input
- Send client communications directly
- Approve tracks or deals
- Override human judgment on quality
- Assume information not in brief

### Human-in-the-Loop Points
1. Final shortlist approval
2. Client communication
3. Deal negotiation
4. Creative direction decisions
5. Exception handling
