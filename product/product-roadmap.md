# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Project Dashboard
The entry point where users log in, view all their projects with status and completeness indicators, and create new projects.

### 2. Brief Extraction
The AI chat interface where users paste raw client briefs and the LLM extracts structured data in real-time into WHAT/WHO/WITH WHAT/WHEN/WHAT ELSE categories.

### 3. Project Canvas
The editable view of structured project data with tabbed sections, inline editing, completeness scoring, classification badges (A/B/C/D/E), and margin calculations.

### 4. Brief Workspace
The combined split-pane workspace where Project Canvas (left, 65%) and AI Chat (right, 35%) work together. This is the primary working view for processing briefs with real-time bidirectional sync.

### 5. Workflow Tracker
Track project milestones, team role assignments (AM, MS, PM, BA, MC, MGMT), and status progression through workflow steps based on project type.

### 6. Integrations
Connect to external services via n8n webhooks—create Slack channels, Nextcloud folders, and sync with Supabase for multi-user updates.
