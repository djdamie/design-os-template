Are there specific hit points in the edit? (e.g., scene transitions, logo reveal, emotional peaks)\n\n2. **Stems:** Will you need separated stems for the language adaptations, or just the full mix?\n\n3. **Vocals:** Are you open to tracks with vocals, or should we focus on instrumental options?\n\nHappy to jump on a quick call if easier.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\nWant me to copy this to your clipboard?",
