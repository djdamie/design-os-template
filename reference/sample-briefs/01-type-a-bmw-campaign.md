Subject: BMW iX - "Electric Future" Global Campaign - URGENT

Hi Team,

Hope you're well! We need your help on a big one.

BMW is launching their new iX electric SUV globally and wants a major music moment.
This is a premium, emotional campaign about the future of mobility.

Campaign: "Electric Future"
Client: BMW AG
Agency: Serviceplan

WHAT WE NEED:
- Hero 60" film for TV/Cinema premiere
- 30" cutdowns for TV
- 15" and 6" social edits
- Multiple language adaptations (DE, EN, FR, ES, IT, CN, JP)

USAGE:
- Global (all territories)
- All media: TV, Cinema, Online, Social, OOH digital, Dealership POS
- 2 year license
- Category exclusivity (automotive)

BUDGET:
We have approved budget of €175,000 for the music license.
Open to sync of existing track OR bespoke composition.

CREATIVE DIRECTION:
We want something that feels:
- Premium and sophisticated
- Forward-looking, optimistic about technology
- Emotional but not cheesy
- Modern electronic elements welcome but needs to feel timeless

References:
- The Blaze "Territory" - love the cinematic build
- Jon Hopkins "Open Eye Signal" - the rolling energy
- Ólafur Arnalds - the emotional electronics
- NOT: Imagine Dragons-style epic rock

The spot follows a father and daughter on a journey through changing landscapes,
from city to mountains to ocean. The music needs to carry the emotional weight
without dialogue for the first 45 seconds.

TIMELINE:
- Kick-off: Monday Dec 16
- First presentation needed: December 20 (before holiday)
- Client presentation: January 6
- Final approval needed: January 15
- Air date: January 25 (Super Bowl adjacent)

This is super tight and high priority. Can you confirm availability?

Best,
Sarah
