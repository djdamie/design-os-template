Subject: Re: Tchibo Easter Campaign Music

Hi,

Quick one - Tchibo needs music for their Easter retail campaign.

30" spot for TV and online. DACH only.
Budget is around 18k all-in.
They want something "feel good" and springy, upbeat but not too young.
Their target is 35-55 year old shoppers.

Something acoustic/indie-folk could work?
Think of cozy Sunday morning vibes.

Need first options by next Wednesday.
Air date is mid-March.

Thanks!
Tom
