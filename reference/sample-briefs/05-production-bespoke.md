Subject: Bespoke Music Request - Bosch "Smart Home" Campaign

Hi TF Team,

We need to discuss a bespoke composition for Bosch's new smart home campaign.

The campaign is called "Home Knows" and is about intuitive technology
that anticipates your needs. Very emotional storytelling about families
and their daily routines made easier by smart tech.

WHY BESPOKE:
The client tried to clear existing tracks but couldn't get the
rights they needed (perpetuity, global, all media). They've decided
a bespoke track gives them full control.

WHAT WE NEED:
- Original composition
- 60" hero version
- 30", 15", 6" cutdowns
- Instrumental version
- Version with vocals
- Full stems for audio post
- Perpetual, global, all media license

CREATIVE DIRECTION:
- Warm and emotional but modern
- Electronic elements that feel "smart" and technological
- Building structure: quiet start, emotional peak, warm resolution
- Female vocal preferred if vocals used
- Think: Sigur Rós meets minimal electronics
- NOT: Stock music / generic corporate feel

BUDGET:
€40,000 for composition + production + buyout

TIMELINE:
- Composer selection: Dec 1
- Demo delivery: Dec 15
- Client feedback: Dec 20
- Final delivery: Jan 10
- Air date: Feb 15

Can we schedule a call to discuss composer options?

Best,
Julia
