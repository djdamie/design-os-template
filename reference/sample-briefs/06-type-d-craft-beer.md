Subject: BrewDog Summer Campaign - Punk IPA

Moin!

Quick one for you - BrewDog Germany is doing a summer push for Punk IPA.
Digital only, nothing massive.

The creative is fun and irreverent - typical BrewDog stuff.
Shows people at rooftop parties, BBQs, that kind of thing.
Tagline is "Punk Your Summer"

What we need:
- 20" pre-roll for YouTube
- 15" and 6" social cuts

Territory: Germany & Austria
Media: Online video only (YouTube, Meta, TikTok)
Term: 3 months (June-August)

Budget: Around 8,000 EUR

Looking for something indie rock, garage-y, a bit rough around the edges.
Think early Arctic Monkeys or The Strokes vibes.
Definitely NOT polished pop or EDM.

Vocals preferred - something with attitude.

Timeline:
- Need options by end of next week
- Final approval: May 28
- Campaign launches June 1

Let me know if you can help!
