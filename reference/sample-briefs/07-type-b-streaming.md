Subject: RE: Wednesday S2 - European Trailer Campaign

Hi there,

Following up on our call - here's the full brief for the Wednesday Season 2 European trailer campaign.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Netflix is launching Season 2 of "Wednesday" in Europe and we need a distinctive music moment for the campaign. The new season goes darker and more gothic than S1.

DELIVERABLES:
- 2:00 theatrical trailer (cinema)
- 60" TV trailer
- 30" TV cutdown
- 15" bumper
- Various social cuts (6", 10", 15")

TERRITORIES:
UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Nordic countries
We'll handle local adaptations internally.

MEDIA:
- Cinema (pre-roll)
- TV (primetime placement)
- Digital/Social

TERM: 18 months from air date

BUDGET:
Total approved: €55,000
Open to sync licensing OR re-record with clearance for full usage.

CREATIVE DIRECTION:
Wednesday S2 leans into the dark academia aesthetic even more. Think:
- Gothic but contemporary
- Mysterious, brooding atmosphere
- Building tension
- Could use classical elements reimagined darkly

Reference tracks:
1. Billie Eilish "bury a friend" - the creepy minimalism
2. Fever Ray "If I Had A Heart" - the dark atmospheric build
3. That viral "Goo Goo Muck" moment from S1 - we want something equally distinctive

Vocal or instrumental both work, but if vocals, they need to fit the dark vibe.
NO upbeat pop. NO generic trailer music. We want something people will Shazam.

KEY SYNC MOMENTS:
- 0:00-0:30: Slow build, establishing shots of Nevermore Academy
- 0:45: First scare beat
- 1:15: Main action sequence begins
- 1:45: Final reveal/title card beat

TIMELINE:
- Kick-off: February 10
- Music options: February 20 (10 working days)
- Client review: February 24-28
- Final master needed: March 10
- Campaign launches: March 28

Please confirm receipt and let us know if you have questions.
