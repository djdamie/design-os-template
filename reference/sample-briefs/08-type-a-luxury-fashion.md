Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Dior Homme FW25 Campaign

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Team,

Dior Homme is preparing its Fall/Winter 2025 global campaign and we're reaching out to a select group of music partners.

CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW:
The FW25 collection is creative director Kim Jones' exploration of masculine vulnerability. The campaign, shot by Steven Meisel, features Timothée Chalamet in an intimate, cinematic narrative filmed in Paris.

DELIVERABLES:
- 90" hero film (online premiere, flagship stores)
- 60" TV/Cinema film
- 30" international TV cut
- 20" and 15" digital pre-roll
- 6" social teasers
- Full track for fashion show (approx. 12 minutes runway)

USAGE:
Territory: Worldwide, all countries
Media: TV, Cinema, Online, Social, OOH, Print (QR to video), Retail POS, Fashion Show
Term: 3 years with option to extend
Exclusivity: Full luxury/fashion category exclusivity

BUDGET:
Music budget allocated: €200,000
This covers sync licensing OR bespoke composition with full buyout.
We're looking for something truly exceptional.

CREATIVE VISION:
The film is an emotional journey - intimate moments intercut with grand Parisian architecture. There's a dreamlike quality, almost like a memory.

We need music that:
- Feels timeless yet contemporary
- Has emotional depth and sophistication
- Could work at a whisper and build to something powerful
- Represents modern masculinity - vulnerable but strong

Sound references (for mood, not match):
- Ryuichi Sakamoto's film work (The Revenant score)
- Arca - the experimental electronics but more accessible
- Woodkid "Run Boy Run" - the cinematic drama
- Classical: Debussy, Satie - impressionist beauty

We want something that could define a cultural moment. Think of how Massive Attack defined the Dior Sauvage era.

NO: Generic fashion music, obvious choices, anything that's been overused in fashion.

CRITICAL TIMING:
- February 15: Kick-off meeting with Kim Jones (available?)
- February 25: First round of options (5-7 tracks minimum)
- March 5: Shortlist presentation to Dior creative team
- March 15: Final selection
- March 25: Masters and stems due
- April 10: Campaign embargo date (STRICT - legal implications)
- June 20: Paris Fashion Week runway

This is a highly confidential project. Please confirm NDA status before we proceed.

Merci beaucoup,
