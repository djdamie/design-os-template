Subject: Project VALORANT Champions 2025 - Anthem Commission

Hello,

Riot Games is looking for music partners for VALORANT Champions 2025, our flagship esports event.

Each year we create an original anthem that becomes a cultural moment in gaming. Previous anthems have included collaborations with artists like Zedd, Imagine Dragons, and Apashe.

PROJECT BRIEF:

We need an original composition that will serve as the official anthem for VALORANT Champions 2025.

DELIVERABLES:
1. Full anthem track (3:00-4:00 minutes)
2. Extended mix for event production (5:00-6:00)
3. :60 trailer version with build
4. :30 TV/broadcast cut
5. :15 and :06 stingers
6. Stems for all versions (drums, bass, synth, vocals, fx separate)
7. Instrumental versions of all above
8. Alternate mixes for in-game implementation

USAGE:
- Global, all territories
- All media perpetual (game, esports broadcast, trailers, social, merch, etc.)
- Full buyout - we need complete ownership

BUDGET:
Production budget: €45,000 (composition + production)
Note: This is for composition only. If we feature a known vocalist, their fee would be separate and negotiated directly.

CREATIVE DIRECTION:

VALORANT Champions represents the pinnacle of competitive gaming. The anthem needs to:

1. ENERGY: High intensity, builds to explosive moments
2. GLOBAL APPEAL: Work across cultures (we have players from Brazil to Korea to Germany)
3. COMPETITIVE SPIRIT: Capture the feeling of going all-in, of being a champion
4. MODERN PRODUCTION: Current sounds, not dated EDM - think hyperpop meets cinematic

Sound palette references:
- Apashe "Uebok" - the aggressive bass design
- Virtual Riot - the intricate sound design
- K/DA "POP/STARS" - how we did crossover appeal
- MARINA - hyperpop melodic approach
- Billie Eilish production - the space and impact

Structure should support:
- Slow intro for player walk-outs
- Build tension
- Explode at drop for highlight moments
- Anthem chorus for crowd singalong
- Breakdown for tactical pauses
- Final build to massive ending

We're open to instrumental OR featuring a vocalist. If instrumental, needs to be melodically memorable. If vocal, lyrics should be universal themes (glory, never giving up, rising) - NOT game-specific.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- 48kHz/24bit minimum
- Master -14 LUFS for streaming, -9 LUFS for venue
- Full stems, clearly labeled
- Pro Tools session or consolidated stems
- Alternate mixes: Radio edit, Clean version if needed

TIMELINE:
- March 1: Brief confirmation
- March 15: Initial concepts (3-5 demos, rough production OK)
- March 25: Feedback and direction lock
- April 10: Second round (2 refined versions)
- April 25: Final selection
- May 15: Final masters and all deliverables
- August 2025: Champions event (specific date TBC)

Happy to set up a call to discuss further.

Best,
Alex Chen
Senior Music Supervisor
